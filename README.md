# pdf-preview-service
since the generation of preview images from pdf files resource intensive - we thought of running this as a separate service on a dedicated machine.

get startet:
- make directory for app and navigate inside the folder
- copy and customize the files :
docker-compose.yml
and
nginx.conf

then run 
docker-compose up
